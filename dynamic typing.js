//Dynamic Typing practice

//javascript is a dynamic language meaning you dont have to specify the type of variable

typeof myName;  //is a 'string'

typeof myAge; //is a 'number'

//typeof is an operator that returns the type of a variable

//typeof example (typeof myName;)

//unlike other languages javascript is dynamic meaning you dont have to specify the type of variable

//they are dynamically typed at runtime based on the value assigned to them

//in javascript there arent multiple types of numbers like in other languages all numbers are just numbers

//in javascript there is only one type of number, string and boolean etc

//because myFirstName is undefined it is a type of undefined and a value of undefined

//because selectedColor is null it is a type of object and a value of null

//dynamic typing example
let myName = "John";

console.log(myName);

console.log(typeof myName);

//the type of myName is a string

myName = 28;

console.log(myName);

console.log(typeof myName);

//the type of myName is now a number
