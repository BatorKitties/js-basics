//constants practice
let interestRate = 0.3;
interestRate = 1; //this will reassign the value of interestRate to 1 which will show up in the console
console.log(interestRate);
//let is used to reassign a value
//const is used to assign a value that will not change
//if you dont need to reassign a value use const
//if you need to reassign a value use let
